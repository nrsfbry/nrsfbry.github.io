        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="text">
        <p>Rain: Water droplets that fall from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface as a result of the condensation of water vapor. It is a crucial element in the Earth's water cycle, providing moisture to plants, replenishing water sources, and influencing weather patterns.
            The rain process involves several complex steps in the air cycle. The following is a brief explanation of the process of rain:

        <h2> 1. Evaporation </h2>
        <div class="text1">
    <center>
        <img src="evaporasi-air.jpg" width="600px">
    </center>
        <p>The process begins when the sun heats the surface air in oceans, rivers, and lakes, causing the air to turn into water vapor. Evaporation can also occur from wet soil and plants through a process called transpiration.</p>
            </div>
        
        <h2> 2. Convection </h2>
        <div class="text2">
    <center>
        <img src="kondensasi.jpg" width="600px">
    </center>
        <p>Air vapor that is lifted into the atmosphere due to evaporation becomes cooler when it reaches higher air layers. This causes condensation, where the water vapor turns back into water droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> 3. Cloud Formation  </h2>
        <div class="text3">
        <p>Microscopic particles such as dust or sea salt serve as freezing nuclei where water vapor collects and forms water droplets or ice crystals. Over time, clouds expand and can reach significant heights.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> 4. Cloud Growth </h2>
        <div class="text3">
        <p>Clouds continue to grow through the accumulation of air droplets or ice crystals. This process can involve collisions between particles and their merging, thus forming larger water droplets.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> 5. Precipitation </h2>
        <div class="text4">
    <center>
        <img src="kondensasi.jpg" width="600px">
    </center>
        <p>When water droplets or ice crystals within a cloud become heavy enough, gravity causes them to fall to Earth as precipitation. If the temperature in the lower layers of the atmosphere is cold enough, 
            then the precipitation can take the form of rain, snow, sleet, or ice pellets.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> 6. Rain on the surface </h2>
        <div class="text5">
        <p>Water droplets or ice crystals that fall to the earth's surface to form rain. Rain can soak into the ground, flow into rivers and lakes, or fill underground water sources.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion </h2>
        <div class="text6">
        <p>Rain is a meteorological phenomenon that involves the fall of air droplets from the atmosphere onto the Earth's surface. It is an important form of precipitation in the hydrologic cycle, playing an important role in providing air for plants, replenishing air sources, and influencing weather patterns. 
            Apart from its functional aspect, rain also has symbolic and cultural meaning in various societies, where it is considered a symbol of fertility, purification and the cycle of life. With its unique characteristics, rain not only has a significant ecological impact but also provides inspiration for 
            artists and writers around the world.</p>
